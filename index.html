		<h1 align=center>Symbolic AI (or "GOFAI")</h1>

		<h2 align=center>The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human
		intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still
		be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be
		difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision.</h2>

		<h2 align=center>"Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, 
		optimization, or neural networks). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated 
		problems. This issue was actively discussed in the 70s and 80s, but in the 1990s mathematical methods and solid scientific st
		andards became the norm, a transition that Russell and Norvig termed "the victory of the neats".</h2>>
